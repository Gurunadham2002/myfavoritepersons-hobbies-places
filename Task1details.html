            <h3>Ooty:</h3>
            <dd>
                Ooty, the charming district of blue mountains is a part of deep Nilgiris. 
                though a lot of it is lost in transition and still very little is actually recorded in government files.
                To actually speak the truth, when a place is so full of scenic beauty and cultural heritage,
                a majority of the tourists are not actually too keen to know the history of the place.
                But if go digging deep into the vaults, the History of Ooty is quite fascinating and bound to throw a surprise or two.
                Thus history of modern Ooty begins when the Collector of Coimbatore,
                John Sullivan, sent up two surveyors, Keys and Mc Mahon, to survey and explore the place.
                Whether you’re looking to explore the region’s history or simply relax and enjoy the beauty of the Nilgiri Hills,
                Ooty is the perfect destination.
